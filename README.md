# Calculator

This React.js project is a simple calculator with features like multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.

You can also use parantheses and commata and toggle the algebraic sign. By pressing a button you are also able to remove one character at a time or delete the whole input in order to start a new calculation.

The site was built with TypeScript and React.js. This App uses the sessionStorage in order to keep the input and the output in sync.
