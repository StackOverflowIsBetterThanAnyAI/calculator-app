# Calculator

This React.js project is a simple calculator with features like multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. You can also use parantheses and commata and toggle the algebraic sign. By pressing a button you are also able to remove one character at a time or delete the whole input in order to start a new calculation. The site was build by typescript and using react. It was my first time using both in combination with recursive functions and sessionStorage. In this project I used sessionStorage in order to keep the input and the output in sync.
